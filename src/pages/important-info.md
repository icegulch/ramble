# Important Info

*   **Directions:** The Randolph Ramble will start and end at the new Community Forest trailhead, at the end of Randolph Hill Road. If using Google Maps, use this address: _Mount Crescent Trail, Randolph Hill Road, Randolph, NH._
*   **Mandatory minimum gear list:** Each participant shall run with a course map (copies will be handed out on race day), at least one-half liter of water, food or snack of some kind, lightweight rain shell, hat, and gloves.
*   **This is an end of the season trail race**, in the Northern White Mountains. Plan accordingly. There may be ice on the course in places—we’ll update our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/randolphramblerace) the day before the race, with the latest course info.
