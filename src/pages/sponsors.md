_The Randolph Ramble wouldn’t have happened without our sponsors. Please support them!_ 

We thank the [Randolph Mountain Club](http://randolphmountainclub.org) the [Randolph Community Forest](http://randolphforest.org), for the use of their trails and the land, Mark and Katie Kelley for the use of their barn, [AVSAR](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Androscoggin-Valley-Search-and-Rescue/163437667019413) for mountain medical support, and all our volunteers! 

We could not have done this without you!
