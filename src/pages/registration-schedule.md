# Registration and Schedule

The registration fee is just $35\. The week prior to the race, it is $40\. The fee includes morning treats from the [White Mountain Café](http://whitemountaincafe.com/).

Proceeds will be donated to the [Randolph Mountain Club](http://www.randolphmountainclub.org).

There will be the following categories:

*   **Men Open**
*   **Women Open**
*   **Men Limmer Division**
*   **Women Limmer Division**

The “Limmer Division” is untimed, for those who want to support the event, but don’t care to race. Limmer Division participants will start at 9:30am with the race at 10am.
