# Registration and Schedule

The registration fee is just $45. The fee includes morning treats from the [White Mountain Café](http://whitemountaincafe.com/) and post race food from [SAALT](https://www.libbysbistro.org/).

Proceeds will be donated to the [Randolph Mountain Club](http://www.randolphmountainclub.org).

There will be the following categories:

- **Men Open**
- **Women Open**
- **Men Limmer Division**
- **Women Limmer Division**

The “Limmer Division” is untimed, for those who want to support the event, but don’t care to race. Limmer Division participants will start at 9:30am with the race at 10am.

Watch our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/randolphramblerace/) for registration and weekend schedule details, as they develop.
