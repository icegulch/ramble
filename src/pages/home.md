The <span style="font-size: 30px; color: #507822;">
Randolph Ramble</span> is a 10 kilometer-long, rugged, self-supported trail race through the Great North Woods in the mountain town of Randolph, New Hampshire, at the base of the Northern Presidentials.

The race places an emphasis on self-sufficiency in the mountains: there are no aid stations and, due to the time of year, there is a mandatory gear list.

The 2022 edition will take place on <span style="font-size: 30px; color: #993399;">Saturday, October 22, 2022 at 10am</span>.
