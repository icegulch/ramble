# Randolph Ramble

The Randolph Ramble is a 10 kilometer-long, rugged, self-supported trail race through the Great North Woods in the mountain town of Randolph, New Hampshire, at the base of the Northern Presidentials.

The race places an emphasis on self-sufficiency in the mountains: there are no aid stations and, due to the time of year, there is a [mandatory gear list](/important-info/).

Registration for this year's event has closed. The [2023 results](/results/) are up!
