# Randolph Ramble

The Randolph Ramble is a 10 kilometer-long, rugged, self-supported trail race through the Great North Woods in the mountain town of Randolph, New Hampshire, at the base of the Northern Presidentials.

The race places an emphasis on self-sufficiency in the mountains: there are no aid stations and, due to the time of year, there is a [mandatory gear list](/important-info/).

This year's event took place on Saturday, October 26 at 10am. Results are [posted](/results/)!

Mark your calendars!! The 2025 installment will take place on Saturday, October 25.
